1. Polymorphism means many forms.
2. We can use the same attributes and methods for many types of objects, objects classes can extend the basic default methods and add to them.
3. We uses the extends keyword to extend an existing class or abstract class.
4. As many forms as we choose to configure.
5. Where we have many types of the same things with different attributes we would extend a superclass of that thing to fit with all the unique differences that the subclasses have.


6. Composition would be where we have a thing that contains a sub-thing that deserves to have its own class, there could be many sub-things in the same thing with similar behaviours, for example a car can have an engine, a body, wheels, seats, each of these could be put in different classes of vehicle such as a boat, truck, plane, etc 
7. When building objects that need to take similar behaviours for multiple different classes, we could also use this where we want to group several similar classes for a certain purpose.
8. Composition allows you to reuse similar behaviours between several different classes, it also allows you to group &  interrogate the similar features of these classes.

9. The objects that compose the objects' super class will remain until they too are removed.
